Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory
================================================

## Before You Start
- [x] Download the sample layouts. We've provided two files:
  - employee_directory.png - an example of what the main directory should look like
  - employee_overlay.png - an example of the overlay providing more detail
  - You will need to create your own HTML, CSS and JS files for this project.

## Project Instructions
- [x] Get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API
Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
  - Image
  - First and Last Name
  - Email
  - City
- [x] Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:
  - Image
  - Name
  - Username
  - Email
  - Cell Number
  - Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code.
  - Birthdate
- [x] Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.
  - Display the users in a grid or table
  - Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.
  - Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window

## Extra Credit
- [x] Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.
- [x] Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
