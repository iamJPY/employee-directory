Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory
================================================

## Before You Start
- [x] Download the sample layouts. We've provided two files:
  - employee_directory.png - an example of what the main directory should look like
  - employee_overlay.png - an example of the overlay providing more detail
  - You will need to create your own HTML, CSS and JS files for this project.

## Project Instructions
- [x] Get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API
Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
  - Image
  - First and Last Name
  - Email
  - City
- [x] Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:
  - Image
  - Name
  - Username
  - Email
  - Cell Number
  - Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code.
  - Birthdate
- [x] Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.
  - Display the users in a grid or table
  - Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.
  - Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window

## Extra Credit
- [x] Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.
- [x] Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.

## Make sure your program is free of syntax errors.
- [] You can monitor any errors by looking at the Developer Tools console in your browser.
- [] Use jsHint (see Resources links) to check your code for syntax and formatting problems. (Installed as an Atom.io plugin)

## Commenting
- [] Make sure you add code comments to explain how your programming works.

## Peer Review
- [] Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist. The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!
